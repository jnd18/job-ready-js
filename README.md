# job-ready-js
A copy of the p1xt guide "Get Job ready - JavaScript Edition - Version 3.0"

This guide comes from https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides.  
I didn't fork that repository because I just wanted the one deprecated guide out of there.

My copy of the guide is annotated with my thoughts and progress.
